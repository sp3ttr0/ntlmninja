# hexahavoc

Automates mitm6 and ntlmrelayx in tmux for authorized IPv6 DNS and NTLM relay testing. Use only on networks you have permission to assess.

## Requirements

- Linux with IPv6 enabled; run as root from an interactive terminal outside tmux.
- Bash, Python 3, tmux, and iproute2 (`ip`).
- `mitm6` and `impacket-ntlmrelayx` available in PATH.
- Standard utilities: `mkdir`, `sleep`, `date`, `mktemp`, and `tee`.

## Usage

```bash
chmod +x hexahavoc.sh
sudo ./hexahavoc.sh -d example.com -t 192.168.1.10 -i eth0 --duration 60
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `-d <domain>` | Target domain (required). |
| `-t <IP>` | Target IPv4/IPv6 address (required; no hostnames or zone IDs). |
| `-i <interface>` | Network interface; default: `eth0`. |
| `-l <folder>` | Output parent folder; default: `dumps/`. |
| `--duration <seconds>` | Positive whole seconds before closing the new session; default: unlimited. |
| `-v` | Trace launcher commands. |
| `-s` | Hide launcher status messages; tool output and errors remain visible. Cannot combine with `-v`. |
| `-h` | Show help. |

## Output and sessions

Each run creates a timestamped folder such as `dumps/2026-09-29_14-30-00_a1B2c3/`, containing separate `mitm6.log` and `ntlmrelayx.log` files plus any files ntlmrelayx generates. Logs include output and errors, remain visible in tmux, and are retained even if the attempt fails. Their presence does not confirm success.

Detaching leaves the tools running. With `--duration`, the session closes automatically even after detaching; leave its `duration` window open. The timer starts after session creation and applies only to new sessions. Without a duration, stop the session manually when finished.

## Offline tests

```bash
bash -n hexahavoc.sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests use mocks and do not run network attacks.
