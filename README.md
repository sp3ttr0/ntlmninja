# ntlmninja

This script automates the setup and execution of an SMB relay attack using tools like Responder, Impacketâ€™s ntlmrelayx, CrackMapExec, and tmux. It identifies misconfigured SMB signing on target machines and launches a relay attack against vulnerable hosts within a managed tmux session.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed and accessible in your system's PATH:
- **tmux**
- **Responder**
- **Impacket**
- **CrackMapExec**

Install these tools as needed before using the script.

## Usage:
```bash
./ntlmninja.sh [-f TARGET_FILE] [options]
```

## Options
```
-f TARGET_FILE       (Required) File containing a list of target IP addresses to scan for misconfigured SMB signing.
-i NETWORK_INTERFACE (Optional) Network interface to use for the attack (default: eth0).
-x                   (Optional) Enable interactive shell in ntlmrelayx (--interactive).
-h                   (Optional) Displays the help message and exits.
```

## Example
```bash
# Run with target file and default interface
./ntlmninja.sh -f targets.txt

# Run with custom interface
./ntlmninja.sh -f targets.txt -i wlan0

# Run with interactive ntlmrelayx shell
./ntlmninja.sh -f targets.txt -x
```

## Important Notes

Responder Configuration:
Ensures SMB and HTTP are disabled in /etc/responder/Responder.conf to prevent conflicts with ntlmrelayx.
